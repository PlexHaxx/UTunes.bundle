# UTunes.bundle
This is a Plex plugin to search YouTube using your existing track and artist information.

I enjoyed having the VEVO videos alongside my albums but unfortunately VEVO has changed their business model and that is no longer available. 
This plugin was a way so I can view music videos from the artists in my current Plex library. 

The plugin uses the Youtube API to search for the videos. This has some limitations such as searching for music videos from a less popular artist that has a common name (eg. Cameras / Maps) and it will return results other than the videos you were looking for. 

Installation Instructions:

1. After unzipping, make sure the folder name is called "UTunes.bundle".
2. Copy or move UTunes.bundle to your plugin directory.

Example Plex Plugin Directories:
